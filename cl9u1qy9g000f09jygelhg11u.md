Let me start off by saying that I'm a master procrastinator. It's not who I wish to be, but it's who I am. This blog is an attempt at fixing that issue. I don't want to set new year resolutions to achieve that (you can guess why my new year resolutions don't work).

My aim here is to constantly upskill myself and write about what I learn. This will also help combat some of the effects of the infamous Imposter syndrome.

I don't want to restrict this blog to a certain topic i.e. I'll most definitely write about almost anything.

Anyway, I don't have much on my mind to write about at the moment. Maybe I'll keep updating this page when I do.
